# MonoVO
Monocular visual odometry code in MatLAB using KITTI dataset

# Intro
This repository is a monocular visual odometry pipeline written in MatLAB and using MatLAB built in functions to preform pure vo on the KITTI dataset. This code draws from Avi Singhs [stereo visual odometry pipeline](https://github.com/avisingh599/vo-howard08/blob/master/README.md). Additionaly, his blog post on [VO](https://avisingh599.github.io/vision/visual-odometry-full/) is also a really good resource to learn about the vo pipeline.
